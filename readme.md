# Personal UI Library

This is a Tailwind UI Library built exclusively with Tailwind CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. It offers a comprehensive collection of templates necessary for constructing a complete website from scratch. Unlike many libraries available today, which are predominantly designed for frameworks like `React` and `Next.js`, this library focuses on simplicity and accessibility.

The files are meticulously organized into HTML and JavaScript components for effortless reusability, making it ideal for various projects. Best of all, it's entirely free to use. Follow these steps to get started:

## Installation

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```cd tailwind-vanilla-ui-library```

3. Initialize Tailwind:
```npm init -y```

4. Install Tailwind CSS:

With these steps completed, you're ready to dive in. The library is fully customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific design preferences.
